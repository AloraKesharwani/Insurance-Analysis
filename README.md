# INSURANCE_ANALYSIS
<p>This dashboard centres on the seamless integration of data cleaning, transformation, and profiling using PowerBI Desktop. It begins by importing data from Excel, followed by a comprehensive data profiling phase where additional columns like "Index" and "Age group" are introduced for enhanced reporting. Each record corresponds to an individual, and subsequent checks ensure data quality by assessing column distribution, profiles, and the absence of errors or null values. The dashboard leverages PowerBI Desktop's report view, employing various visual formatting techniques to create an informative and visually appealing representation of the enriched dataset. This approach ensures a solid foundation for insightful reporting and decision-making.

As per the reporting requirement, it is required to identify each individual by a unique ID. That’s why the name index column is replaced with an ID column.
Minimum age is 18 or maximum is 64. Age group column: using the conditioning column (if age is less than 25, then consider A1).(If age is less than 51, then consider A2); otherwise,  A3)
According to this column, we tried to categorise people or put people in different categories according to their age group.

  <b>2. AVERAGE CHARGES BY AGE GROUP:</b> 

  Stacked bar charts represent average charges for all different age groups; there are three different age groups. A1, A2, and A3. Charts show high to low charges according to age group (A3, A2, and A1). A3 considers an age group of 51 to 64, A2 considers an age group of 25 to 50, and A1 considers an age group of less than 25.

  <b>3. NUMBER OF SMOKERS :</b> 
  
</p>This donut chart represents the proposition of people who are smokers or non-smokers. It represents that the number of people who are smokers is equal to 0.27k, and the percentage is 20.48%. The non-smoker count is 1.06k in numbers and, in percentage, 79.52%. The higher proportion of non-smokers suggests a potentially lower risk profile for the overall insured population, as non-smokers generally exhibit lower health risks and may require fewer claims.<p>
  
  <b>4. NUMBER OF CUSTOMER BY AGE GROUP:</b> 
  
The profit by category chart gives managers the ability to have a wide range of information in just one chart, by drilling up they can have information about the overall profit of each product category and by drilling down they can find the most valuable products and the slow-mover ones. This can help production to put their resources into producing profitable goods and perhaps stop the production of goods with little to no profit

<p>
  <b>5. PROFIT BY STATES:</b> 
  Determining the top-performing state by analysing various metrics. By evaluating metrics such as total sales, customer acquisition, and profitability by state, businesses can identify the region contributing the most to overall success. This analysis guides strategic decisions, allowing businesses to focus resources, marketing efforts, and customer engagement strategies on the top-performing state for sustained growth and market dominance. Identifying and targeting top customers based on higher spending for special discounts and coupons is a strategic approach to cultivating preferred customer relationships.
