<p>This dashboard centres on the seamless integration of data cleaning, transformation, and profiling using PowerBI Desktop. It begins by importing data from Excel, followed by a comprehensive data profiling phase where additional columns like "Index" and "Age group" are introduced for enhanced reporting. Each record corresponds to an individual, and subsequent checks ensure data quality by assessing column distribution, profiles, and the absence of errors or null values. The dashboard leverages PowerBI Desktop's report view, employing various visual formatting techniques to create an informative and visually appealing representation of the enriched dataset. This approach ensures a solid foundation for insightful reporting and decision-making.

In 2023, there is a slight dip in Q1, but profits increase again in Q2, Q3, and Q4.

  <b>4. PROFIT BY CATEGORY:</b> 
  
The profit by category chart gives managers the ability to have a wide range of information in just one chart, by drilling up they can have information about the overall profit of each product category and by drilling down they can find the most valuable products and the slow-mover ones. This can help production to put their resources into producing profitable goods and perhaps stop the production of goods with little to no profit

  <b>5. PROFIT BY STATES:</b> 
  Determining the top-performing state by analysing various metrics. By evaluating metrics such as total sales, customer acquisition, and profitability by state, businesses can identify the region contributing the most to overall success. This analysis guides strategic decisions, allowing businesses to focus resources, marketing efforts, and customer engagement strategies on the top-performing state for sustained growth and market dominance. Identifying and targeting top customers based on higher spending for special discounts and coupons is a strategic approach to cultivating preferred customer relationships.
